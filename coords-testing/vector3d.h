	// as a Spheric coordinate tuple.

	// ======== Conversions ======== //
	// Return a copy of this vector in spherical coordinates
	// Calling this on a cartesian vector will result in garbage values
	Vector3D Spheric();

	// Calling this on a cartesian vector will result in garbage values

	// ======== Vector algebra ======== //
	// Return the projection of this onto u
	Vector3D Project(Vector3D u);

	// Return the dot product of this vector and u
	double dotp(Vector3D u);

	// Return the cross-product of this vector and u
	Vector3D crossp(Vector3D u);

	// Angle between two vectors
	// NOTE: This should maybe be static, or renamed for clarity
	double angle(Vector3D u);

	// ======== Operator overloads ======== //
	// Vector addition
	Vector3D operator+(Vector3D u);

	Vector3D operator-(Vector3D u);

	// Reuses the % operator since it looks similar to a тип
	Vector3D operator%(Vector3D u);

	// Get components
